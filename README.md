# Chatr (Not the telecommunication company)
#### Author: Ric Sign

Chatr is an app created using React, Firebase, Tensorflow.js and MUI to combat toxic message and online bullying. Please visit [this website](https://ricsign.github.io/chatr/) for a live demo. 


## Intuition and Purposes
Online message provides great convenience to our lives. However, toxic messages can signficantly detriment our mental health. Online bullying and toxic message can lead to very serious consequences and should not be overlooked.

This app is a simulation of a chat application, and the app will evaluate each and every message a user sent, and return a score based on its toxicity. For toxic message, the app will automatically warn the user and further actions can be taken by the system administration.

## How to Use
You can use this chat app like any other chat apps you use. If it is your first time using this app, you will be asked to sign in with Google.

You simply type whatever you are going to send and press enter. The message will be stored in the database and be evaluated using machine learning model. The color on the side indicates how healthy it is (the greener the healthier). If it says "H", even the color is not entirely green, it is still healthy; "T" means this message is toxic.

When you type a toxic message, the system will warn you.

In addition, you can check your score in the console. It is a score ranged from 0 - 1. The closer to 1 it is, the healthier (less toxic) it is.
